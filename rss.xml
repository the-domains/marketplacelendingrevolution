            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The State of Online Small Business Lending</h1><p>In small business lending, it means access to industry-wide information on eligibility requirements and rate trends. It means clear and concise explanations of all the different loan products available. It means holding lenders and brokers accountable for their actions, and enforcing honesty on every level.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Secured Lender</h1><p>Credit risk is the potential that
expected or unexpected events will have adverse effects on a lender's earnings,
capital or franchise or enterprise value. Credit risk may arise from inadequate
accounting and inventory control systems, poor collection practices or
inaccurate collateral valuation, among other factors. It is imperative that
management and operational professionals share the knowledge and experience to
recognize, assess, mitigate and monitor the risks unique to asset-based lending
(ABL). Success or failure in serving a customer efficiently while managing
credit risk depends on understanding the role one plays in the company and also
how well the teams work together. Here we will examine the role of operations
professionals in successfully managing credit risk.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e16982876395e381c34c62fe00b4546d7ef8490c.png"></article>]]></description>
