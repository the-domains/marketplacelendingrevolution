description: 'In March 2014, The Economist published Banking without banks, declaring that peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms were set to disrupt banks and other traditional sources of capital by directly connecting borrowers to individual lenders. In the past few years, the so-called P2P lending industry has certainly experienced tremendous growth, with origination volume doubling annually, reaching $24 billion globally in 2014.'
