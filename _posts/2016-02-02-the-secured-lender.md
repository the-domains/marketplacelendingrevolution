Credit risk is the potential that
expected or unexpected events will have adverse effects on a lender's earnings,
capital or franchise or enterprise value. Credit risk may arise from inadequate
accounting and inventory control systems, poor collection practices or
inaccurate collateral valuation, among other factors. It is imperative that
management and operational professionals share the knowledge and experience to
recognize, assess, mitigate and monitor the risks unique to asset-based lending
(ABL). Success or failure in serving a customer efficiently while managing
credit risk depends on understanding the role one plays in the company and also
how well the teams work together. Here we will examine the role of operations
professionals in successfully managing credit risk.
