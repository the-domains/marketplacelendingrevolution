The question for online lenders is whether or not they can entwine their business closely enough with their partner bank to ensure that any hypothetical court case can't wedge them apart (a move towards selling participations in loans, rather than the whole loan itself, could help this). The question for everyone else, as online lending grabs more and more of the consumer loan sector, is whether or not to tolerate the erosion of usury caps (and what anyone could do about it anyway).
