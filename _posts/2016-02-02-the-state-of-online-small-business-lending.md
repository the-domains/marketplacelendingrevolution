description: "In small business lending, it means access to industry-wide information on eligibility requirements and rate trends. It means clear and concise explanations of all the different loan products available. It means holding lenders and brokers accountable for their actions, and enforcing honesty on every level. Here at Fundera, we're no strangers to transparency."

1. Medium-term lenders are gaining more market share, possibly inspiring top short-term lenders to introduce multi-year loan products
2. For the purposes of this and future quarterly reports, Fundera will be dividing its line of credit product into two subcategories: medium-term lines of credit and short-term lines of credit
3. This short-term line of credit product serves a riskier borrower class, increasing the product diversity available to borrowers with lower credit scores
